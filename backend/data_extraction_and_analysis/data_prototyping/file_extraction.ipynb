      "Hi Jeevan, That’s awesome to hear you’re so open to feedback. In future applications, I encourage you to be introspective about your own learning and to think about how an LA can not only influence students like you, but also students who are different than you. A strong LA is someone is who doesn’t necessarily have significant teaching or tutoring experience but one who recognizes the inherent struggles of these classes like those that are both external (grade based) and internal (imposter phenomena) and is willing to work with students in both areas. I hope this helps and I sincerely hope you apply again in upcoming semesters.\n",

      "“In fact, what we call ‘merit’ in an elitist society is an amalgam of native endowments and environmental privileges… . The conscience of a civilized society, and the dictates of social justice demand that 'merit' and 'equality' are not turned into a fetish and the element of privilege is duly recognized, and discounted for when 'unequals' are made to run the same race.” This was the rationale given by the Mandal Commission for affirmative action. Was the Mandal Commission right? Evaluate the competing claims of merit and deprivation in India’s affirmative action program.\n",
      "The Mandal commission was correct, a meritocracy is not equivalent to equality. There must be special considerations. Affirmative action is needed because of the systematic oppression of lower castes in India, the positive effect it has on education and income levels of lower castes, and the positive effect it has on efficiency and diversity in the workplace.\n",

      "Question 2: When evaluating chat messages from players in a multiplayer game, we want to be able to locate certain keyphrases and determine the longest version of the substring containing them. In particular, we want to find the longest substring in a message that begins and ends with a given keyphrase. Write a recursive function that takes in a string message and a non-empty string keyphrase, and returns the length of the largest substring of the message that starts and ends with the keyphrase. If there are no substrings that begin and end with the keyphrase, return 0. Notes: This function should look for exact matches (case-sensitive). The keyphrase at the beginning and end of the substring can fully or partially overlap (see examples below). Examples: base pattern output teamplayeronateam team 17 (not overlapped) himynameis name 4 (fully overlapped) ab11cdef1g 1 7 (not overlapped) 312121 121 5 (partially overlapped) Requirements: You must use recursion by making recursive calls directly to the given function. No for/while keywords, maps, filters, or inner/lambda functions. You should not use find() or any other similar methods.\n",

We want to be able to parse the data in the list easily, so our task is to write a recursive function that takes in a list and returns a 1D version of it (i.e. if we pass in [[1, 2], 3], we should get [1, 2, 3] returned). Note: Try testing on smaller lists first to get an idea of what your base case would be and what your recursive calls would look like. Try tracing out your recursive calls on paper for specific examples to see what each one is doing and what and when it returns.\n",

Given two strings representing your record of playing as crews and imposters, return a list of two values: [# of total games won, # of total games lost] Restrictions (in addition to global restrictions): You should NOT use the built-in function str.count() to solve this question. Notes: 1. You may assume that wins are always encoded as 'W' (uppercase), losses are always encoded as 'L' (uppercase). Any other character might exist to represent other types of results, but they don’t count towards either wins or losses. 2. You should NOT assume the two strings have the same length. 3. Recursive calls do not always need to be inside of a return statement. Think about how you can use this in order to build out the list\n",

      "Because of the wide range of traditions and ideas covered by the term Hinduism, arriving at a comprehensive definition is difficult.[40] The religion \"defies our desire to define and categorize it\".[62] Hinduism has been variously defined as a religion, a religious tradition, a set of religious beliefs, and \"a way of life\".[63][note 1] From a Western lexical standpoint, Hinduism like other faiths is appropriately referred to as a religion. In India, the term dharma is preferred, which is broader than the Western term religion.[64] The study of India and its cultures and religions, and the definition of \"Hinduism\", has been shaped by the interests of colonialism and by Western notions of religion.[65][66] Since the 1990s, those influences and its outcomes have been the topic of debate among scholars of Hinduism,[65][note 15] and have also been taken over by critics of the Western view on India.[67][note 16]\n",

In Jainism a Jina as deva is not an avatar (incarnation), but the highest state of omniscience that an ascetic tirthankara achieved.[143] Out of the 24 Tirthankaras, Jains predominantly worship four: Mahāvīra, Parshvanatha, Neminatha and Rishabhanatha.[144] Among the non-tirthankara saints, devotional worship is common for Bahubali among the Digambaras.[145] The Panch Kalyanaka rituals remember the five life events of the tirthankaras, including the Panch Kalyanaka Pratishtha Mahotsava, Panch Kalyanaka Puja and Snatrapuja.[146][147]\n",

Do pay a lot of attention to the role and team and make sure to push for a project and role you actually want - the point is for you to learn and get experience, and students don’t have enough summers to try every role sadly, and you want to figure out post-grad plans. It’s okay to really push them on it and say “Hey, I’m not interested in front end at all so I’d love to work on backend, distributed systems stuff” or “I’d like to try full stack development so please match me appropriately” - whatever you’re interested in so far.
